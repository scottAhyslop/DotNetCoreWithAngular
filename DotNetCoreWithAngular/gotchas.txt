Once you've got the project built, Angular needs the fololowing:

Go into Package Manager Console found in Tools

npm install -g @angular/cli@8.3.29 

this will not give you the latest version, but the MS only wants it running in 8

docs on Angular CLI: https://angular.io/cli

Update to latest chokidar: 
npm i chokidar

Some Angular dependencies have troubles with the latest versions of Node
npm i node@14.17.3  seems to work with everything

Angular/compiler has some issues
npm i @angular/compiler@8.2.14
or 
npm i @angular/compiler@8.2.12
 it will continuinally issue warnings about this, but afeter paying whack-a-mole a few times, I settled on 8.2.14 which doesn't complain

An ini format parser that initially installs to a low, ghigh security alert warning version, this updates it

npm i ini
