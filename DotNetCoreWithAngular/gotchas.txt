Once you've got the project built, Angular needs the fololowing:

**Go into Package Manager Console found in Tools
npm install -g @angular/cli@8.3.29 
- this will not give you the latest version, but MS only wants it running in 8

**Audit your newly updated packages
npm audit fix
- will automatically update and fix everything, except for a couple of packages that made need dev attention
npm audit
- gives you a list of all vulnerabilities but does not fix them, just lists them and some updated libraries will break other dependencies aka dependency hell

** Docs on Angular CLI: https://angular.io/cli

** Update to latest chokidar: 
npm i chokidar

** Some Angular dependencies have troubles with the latest versions of Node
npm i node@14.17.3  
- seems to work with everything

** Angular/compiler has some issues
npm i @angular/compiler@8.2.14
or 
npm i @angular/compiler@8.2.12
- it will continuinally issue warnings about this, but after paying whack-a-mole a few times, I settled on 8.2.14 which doesn't complain

**An ini format parser that initially installs to a low, high-security alert warning version, this updates it

npm i ini

** to add a new component, go up to the root of ClientApp

ng g c 'test' --skip-import 
- test is name of component, skip-import prevents the re-adding of dependencies

** at the MS Project root you can type
dotnet restore 
and it will restore all the nuget packages, but will not update any of your Angular deps, so run the above steps to do that
